# API_Exercices_DOM_JS
This is the repo of an exercice first made as ES5 that's going to be remake with ES6 syntaxes.
First, all this programming web page connected to an API was written in French then re-edited in English before his complete remake as ES6.
Notice that, it is basically a French application so only code is written in English.

This exercice is, first, just made with full Vanilla JS
