# API_Exercices_DOM_JS

<h2>Intro</h2>

This is the repo of an exercice first made as ES5 that's going to be remake with ES6 syntaxes.
The purpose of this exercice is to connect a web page to an API, get and send informations to this API and finally display it as a list.
The programming of this page is full of Vanilla JS.
Notice that, it is basically a French application so only code is written in English.

<h2>About the API</h2>

It's an OpenClassRooms API.
This API contains informations about web links that exists all over the world (the web?) as known applications are often listed.
Users who uses OpenClassRooms API just train to share their favor links and for developement experience.

<h2>Main purpose of this exercice</h2>

I wanted to train on this exercice, because first I've learn to do it in ES5 javascript.
Time has passed and I have now learned ES6 syntaxes with some frameworks.
Each branches of this repo will contain differents versions and points I have trained on this exercice.

Let's have an idea of my level by looking for my work, 

Have a good reading =)
